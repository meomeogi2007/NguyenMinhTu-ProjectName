                        - Freddy Fazbear is the title antagonist of the Five Nights at Freddy's franchise, who later
                        appears as multiple variations in the succeeding games, and is the mascot of Freddy Fazbear's
                        Pizza. He is an animatronic bear who, like most of the animatronics in the games, is left in a
                        "free-roaming mode" at night, during which he wanders around Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, along with
                        the other animatronics, until 6 AM, to prevent their servos from locking up.
                        <br>
                        - Like the other animatronics, Freddy Fazbear will try to forcefully stuff any human he sees
                        after hours into an animatronic suit, resulting in the death of the person in question.
                        Secretly Freddy and the other animatronics are haunted by children murdered by a man named
                        William Afton.
                        <div class="neat-header">Physical Appearance</div>
                        <div class="under-neat-header">Classic Freddy</div>
                        <br>
                        - Freddy is a brown animatronic bear with a light shade of brown on both his stomach and puffy
                        muzzle. On stage, he wears a black top hat, black bow tie with a neck strap, and wields a
                        microphone with his right hand. He has thick black eyebrows, three-toed feet, and three blackish
                        freckles on both sides of his muzzle. From his palms and underneath his fingers he has what
                        appears to be paw-like prints. His round ears are articulated and are thus able to move
                        backwards and forward (similar to the ears of several other animatronics). Freddy sports
                        squarish, human-like teeth from his lower jaw, and, like most of the animatronics at the
                        pizzeria (except for Foxy), has no visible teeth on his upper jaw. His fur color, in Help
                        Wanted, is more desaturated while the texture is more matted and scratchy, but has a more
                        reflective shiny suit in Special Delivery as if made of different material.
                        <br>
                        - He has human handprints on the right side of his face and chin from the left (see picture
                        above left), though they are difficult to locate. His irises are normally of a light, baby blue
                        color, although, presumably for paranormal reasons, they become glossy-black when he is commonly
                        seen on-camera and in one of his jumpscares, rather than his normal costume eyes. The only
                        exceptions with him and his costume eyes are, in the group stare onstage, when he is coming down
                        the East Hall, and when he is in the doorway when the power runs out. He and Foxy are the only
                        two animatronics whose pupils glow white in the dark.
                        <div class="under-neat-header">Withered Freddy</div>
                        <br>
                        - As Withered Freddy, he is the older, withered incarnation first making an appearance in Five
                        Nights at Freddy's 2 as the titular antagonist, as well as making a cameo appearance in Freddy
                        Fazbear's Pizzeria Simulator and later returned in Five Nights at Freddy's VR: Help Wanted as an
                        antagonist. He, along with the four other older animatronics have all fallen into severe
                        disrepair and he is replaced by his newer counterpart for the "improved" Freddy Fazbear's Pizza,
                        Toy Freddy. It is explained that he has gone through an attempted retrofit, but was left
                        unfinished after the management chose to make Toy Freddy (much like the other original
                        animatronics being replaced by their respective counterparts).[2] Out of all of the original
                        animatronics, Withered Freddy seems to be the least damaged, with only a few tears through his
                        body. This version of Freddy is later retrofitted and redesigned into the classic Freddy for the
                        events of the first game.

                - Withered Freddy's overall appearance is unchanged, but small differences are visible - mainly
            the buttons added to his chest, and a more visible stitching on the underside of his arms. Most
            notably, however, is the damage on his arms similar to that of Foxy's, showing parts of his
            endoskeleton. He also seems to be lacking kneecaps. Additionally, both of his knees are damaged;
            with visible wires poking out of his left knee. His body segment is also smaller and his hat is
            removable, as it is seen sitting on the floor next to him in the Parts/Service room. It should
            be noted that he still holds a microphone. This time around, Withered Freddy has an upper set of
            teeth, while his head appears far blockier. In addition to this, part of Freddy's endoskeleton
            teeth are also slightly visible. His freckles are gone, his eyebrows are thinner, and he has
            embossed inner ears. His eyes are in a slightly different position, meaning one of his eyes go
            up and down, and also seem to have been placed deeper within the mask. Also, his muzzle appears
            to be smaller and much rounder. The reason for his disrepair is due to neglect by the company
            and the fact that he is simply used as spare parts for the newer animatronics. Withered Freddy's
            pupils can sometimes be seen illuminating white glows.
