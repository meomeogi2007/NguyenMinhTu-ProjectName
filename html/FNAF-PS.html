                                    - The game starts as an 8-bit style minigame. In this minigame, players control
                                    Freddy Fazbear. The objective is to collect pizzas, and launch them toward
                                    customers. Another Freddy sprite later appears, acting as an obstacle which blocks
                                    the pizzas. The minigame then glitches, and takes the player to the next screen.
                                    <br>
                                    - After the glitch, the player finds themselves sitting at a desk with a cassette
                                    recorder and a sheet of paper. In front of them is a damaged version of Circus Baby.
                                    The man on the cassette tape then goes through multiple audio prompts with eerie
                                    noises to test the movements of the animatronic.
                                    <br>
                                    - The cassette recorder stops, and the damaged animatronic looks toward the screen.
                                    <br>
                                    - The player is then taken to the title screen.
                                    <br>
                                    - Upon starting the game, the objective requires the player to fill up their
                                    pizzeria with items from a catalog that reflect atmosphere, safety, entertainment,
                                    and bonus revenue. The player must also avoid items with a liability risk in order
                                    to prevent lawsuits, as described by Tutorial Unit.
                                    <br>
                                    - The player then enters a dark office with a computer in front of them and two
                                    vents to the left and right. The goal of this part of the game is to complete all
                                    the tasks listed on the computer.
                                    <br>
                                    - If the player salvaged an animatronic or if there is one loose, then the player
                                    must also attempt to prevent the animatronics from getting to the office.
                                    <br>
                                    - This is done by turning off the computer and fan, but this will also cause the
                                    temperature to rise. If the temperature in the office reaches 120Â° Fahrenheit, then
                                    the player will pass out. Turning on the computer and fan lowers the temperature,
                                    but causes noise, alerting the animatronics to the office.
                                    <br>
                                    - If the player accepts any sponsorship deals, advertisements can also appear,
                                    making more noise.
                                    <br>
                                    - If an animatronic is in an air vent, the player can shine their flashlight into
                                    the vent. There is also audio that the player can use to lure the animatronics away
                                    from the office. When finishing up the tasks, the player must log off their computer
                                    to complete the night.
                                    <br>
                                    - Between nights, the player will be presented with an animatronic that was found in
                                    an alley. The player will be given a choice on whether to salvage the animatronic,
                                    or put it back in the alley.
                                    <br>
                                    - Salvaging the animatronic will yield a revenue bonus. Throwing the animatronic
                                    back into the alley will yield no bonus, but the animatronic will not be loose in
                                    the pizzeria. When salvaging an animatronic, they must make sure that the
                                    animatronic does not come too close, or it will jumpscare them, and the bonus
                                    revenue will be lost. The player can use a taser to get the animatronic back to a
                                    stable position, but using it more than three times decreases the animatronic's
                                    salvage value.

                        - Both of Scott Cawthon's known websites were turned to black for several months.
                        <br>
                        - Scott announced that he had stopped working on the game and began focusing on a new one. This
                        was widely assumed to be a ruse, until Scott submitted a Reddit post that stated otherwise.
                        <br>
                        - A teaser image was added to fnafworld.com, while scottgames.com was teasing the second book.
                        Scottgames.com later turned to an image of static just before the release of the book.
                        <br>
                        - Between August and November, there were three teasers of Freddy with a cake, Freddy close to
                        three children, and Freddy juggling pizzas. This was speculated to be a pizzeria tycoon game,
                        which was hinted back in June.
                        <br>
                        - The title of the game was confirmed via a teaser on scottgames.com. The game was released two
                        days later
                        <br>
                        - On February 18, 2018, Scott announced an update to the game featuring Ultimate Custom Night,
                        containing fifty animatronics. The update release was planned on August 8, 2018 (4th anniversary
                        of series). However, on May 30, Scott revealed that UCN will be a standalone game, which was
