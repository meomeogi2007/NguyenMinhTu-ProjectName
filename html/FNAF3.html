                            - Thirty years after Freddy Fazbear's Pizza closed its doors, the events that took place
                            there have become nothing more than a rumor and a childhood memory, but the owners of
                            "Fazbear's Fright: The Horror Attraction" are determined to revive the legend and make the
                            experience as authentic as possible for patrons, going to great lengths to find anything
                            that might have survived decades of neglect and ruin.
                            <br>
                            - At first, there were only empty shells, a hand, a hook, and an old paper-plate doll, but
                            then a remarkable discovery was made...
                            <br>
                            - The attraction now has one animatronic.

                        - On November 16, 2014, before the game's official reveal, Scott's website only displayed the
                        site header and the word "'offline." Brightening the picture shows small text in the bottom left
                        corner of the image saying "until next time." When viewing the image's code, one could find that
                        the alt-text read "soon." This "soon" was removed on December 8, 2014, but was re-added the same
                        day - likely a mistake.

                        - On December 6, 2014, when brightened, Scott's website had a very large number three on the
                        bottom right, hinting at a third installment to the Five Nights at Freddy's series. The same
                        day, however, the large three was removed from the bottom right, leaving only the word
                        "offline." This third image did not include the words "until next time," either.
                        <br>
                        - On December 7, 2014, the 3 was re-added. Furthermore, when viewing the page's source, it
                        displays the keywords of the page as: "five, nights, at, freddys, 30 years later, only one."
                        Earlier versions read "20 years later," and "only one left."
                        <br>
                        - As of December 9th, 2014, the 3 was removed and replaced by a "Merry Christmas!" message below
                        the "offline" text. The page's source has also changed to say "five nights at freddys, taking a
                        break, Merry Christmas everyone! :)". The "soon" alt-text has also been removed again.
                        <br>
                        - On January 3rd, the "offline" image was replaced with a picture of Springtrap's face looking
                        out from the darkness with the accompanying text, "I am still here." When brightened, a tiny
                        gray 3 can be seen in the bottom-right corner. In the source code, there is text that says "I
                        remain" - replacing the previous Christmas message. The source code also reveals that this new
                        image is named "fnaf3.jpg".
                        <br>
                        - On January 14th, the website is updated, revealing a teaser of the animatronics' empty heads,
                        including the paperpal, inside a box. A big, red "3" is seen above them. When the image is
                        brightened, Springtrap is seen standing to the right of the box. The source code still has the
                        "I remain" text, but the image is named "whatcanweuse.jpg".
                        <br>
                        - On January 26, 2015, Scott released the teaser trailer for Five Nights at Freddy's 3 on its
                        Steam Greenlight page, the page also containing various in-game screenshots.
                        <br>
                        - The game was officially released on March 2, 2015 - first, as a demo given out to Let's

                        - Omri Petitte from PC Gamer gave Five Nights at Freddy's 3 a score of 77 out of 100, praising
                        the reworked camera system, but commented on how the jumpscares from the other animatronics
                        "felt a little stale by the third night." In a more critical review, Nic Rowen from Destructoid
                        gave the game a 6.5 out of 10, saying that, even though the game is "by far the most technically
                        proficient and mechanically satisfying installment yet," he criticized Springtrap and Fazbear's
                        Fright for lacking the "charm of the original cast and locations."
