                            - Welcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike
                            come
                            for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see!
                            <br>
                            - The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course, and his two friends. They are
                            animatronic
                            robots, programmed to please the crowds!
                            <br>
                            - The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night, however, and it was much
                            cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman. From your small office,
                            you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity
                            that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you
                            run out of power for the night — no more security doors and no more lights! If something
                            isn't right — namely, if Freddy Fazbear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you
                            must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!
                            <br>
                            - Can you survive Five Nights at Freddy's?

                                    the restaurant to observe the animatronic mascots. The player has a limited amount
                                    of power to view the camera feeds, light hallways, and close the doors on either
                                    side of them.

                                    - The player must use the camera feed locations in the building and hold the
                                    animatronics off using the doors. If the player fails to do this, they will be
                                    jumpscared and receive a Game Over. To advance to the next night, the player must
                                    survive from 12:00 AM to 6:00 AM (8 minutes and 37 seconds in real-time).

                                    his three friends: Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy. There is an additional animatronic known
                                    as Golden Freddy who only appears when the player experiences a hallucination.

                        - Five Nights at Freddy's received positive reviews from critics. Indie Game Magazine praised
                        Five Nights at Freddy's for its simple take on the horror genre, noting that its artistic
                        direction and gameplay mechanics contributed to a feeling of "brutal tension" only worsened by
                        how a player may be familiar with similar restaurants such as Chuck E. Cheese's, and that "it's
                        an incredibly terrifying experience to try to save yourself from the single jump scare that ends
                        the game."
                        <br>
                        - Five Nights at Freddy's was described as a "fantastic example of how cleverness in design and
                        subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying." However, the game was criticized for
                        taking too long to load when launched.
                        <br>
                        - Omri Petitte for PC Gamer gave Five Nights at Freddy's a score of 80 out of 100, commenting
                        that the game took a "less-is-more" approach to its design and that while "the AI isn't some
                        masterwork of procedural unpredictability," it would "[still] head straight to you and eat your
                        face off, or it'll play around like an innocent child before closing in for the kill. Your mind
                        will fill in the rest."
                        <br>
                        - The game's overall atmosphere was praised for emphasizing the fear and suspense of an
                        approaching threat rather than the arrival of the threat itself executed frequently in other
                        horror-oriented games. However, the gameplay of Five Nights at Freddy's was criticized for
                        becoming repetitive once a player masters it, as there is "not much more to expect beyond
                        managing battery life and careful timing of slamming doors shut, so those with steely willpower
                        won't find anything else past the atmosphere of it all."
                        <br>
                        - Ryan Bates of Game Revolution gave the game a 4.5 out of 5, comparing its camera-oriented
                        gameplay to the 1992 game Night Trap. He praised the game's minimalistic presentation (with
                        particular emphasis on its audio design and lack of music) for contributing to the terror of the
                        game, along with the fact that the "nervous impulses" of its repetitive gameplay would reach
                        "almost OCD-type levels, adding to the tense environment." In conclusion, he felt that the game
                        was "horror done right," but that it was too short.
                        <br>
                        - Eurogamer's Jeffrey Matulef compared the animatronic animals in the game to Weeping Angels,
                        who are predatory creatures from the universe of Doctor Who, due to their ability to only move
                        when they are not being observed.
                        <br>
                        - Softpedia gave the game 4 out of 5 stars, with reviewer Cosmin Anton noting that it "drifts
                        away from the classic first-person horror survival titles," but that the "inability to move
                        combined with the limited power available will make you feel quite helpless in front of those
                        relentless robots that just want to share a bit of their 'love' with you."
