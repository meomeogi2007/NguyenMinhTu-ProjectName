                        <br>
                        - Mangle is one of the secondary antagonists in the Five Nights at Freddy's franchise, first
                        appearing in Five Nights at Freddy's 2. They are a reimagined version of the original Foxy, and
                        was later repurposed after being severely damaged.
                        <div class="neat-header">Physical Appearance</div>
                        <br>
                        - Unlike most other versions of Foxy, Mangle is meant to be a clown. They are also the most
                        damaged and irreparable version of Foxy.
                        <br>
                        - Mangle has red cheeks, as well as lipstick haphazardly dotted on their elongated snout. They
                        also have pink eyelids and long eyelashes. Their teeth are also smaller, but their
                        endoskeleton's teeth are also visible. A pink bow tie is also attached to their bent chassis,
                        and their eyes also appear to be more realistic in design than the others. They also have a
                        second head that seems completely endoskeleton in design, which bears Mangle's left eye on it.
                        If looked at closely, it can be seen that Mangle has pink nail polish on their feet.
                        <br>
                        - Mangle is clearly in a disfigured and mutilated state, completely to the point of being
                        non-fixable. Mangle also does not seem to have a suit at all, them being almost entirely an
                        endoskeleton, except for their head, both of their hands, one of their feet, and a spherical
                        white tail, which remains attached to their endoskeleton. Mangle's head is white and has pale
                        red accents on their inner ear, snout, and around their eyes. Their right eye is still attached
                        to their costumed head, unlike their left eye, which is still attached to their endoskeleton
                        head. They appear to be the only toy animatronic in a worse state than their older counterparts.

                - Their costume head also appears to be dislocated from the endoskeleton's head, which can be seen
                attached to a neck-like limb near them. Mangle appears to be almost entirely made out of endoskeleton
                limbs. Wires hang from multiple parts of their body. There are also three eyes of their
                multiple-endoskeleton-like body that can be seen when Mangle is in the Kid's Cove.
                <br>
                - In Five Nights at Freddy's VR: Help Wanted, Mangle's tail is colored with a pink end. This can be seen
                when viewing their model in the Gallery.

                <br>
                - Revealed in Ultimate Custom Night, Mangle is aware of the fact that they are in severe disrepair.
                Their voice uses several different pitches (both masculine and feminine) at once while also sounding
                somewhat distorted. Scott Cawthon describes Mangle's voice as being almost indiscernible (playing into
                the running gag of Mangle's gender being ambiguous). As seen in Five Nights at Freddy's AR: Special
                Delivery, it appears that they have multiple personalities inhabiting them (much like Ennard). They also
                do not speak in multiple pitches simultaneously, and instead uses different pitches and tones depending
                on which personality is active.

                - The cause for Mangle's severely mutilated state, as noted by Phone Guy from the second game, is due to
                the exposure to toddlers, who would constantly rip them apart, piece by piece, forcing the staff to
                reassemble them after every shift. Eventually, the staff decided that Mangle would become a "take apart
                and put together attraction" for the younger kids to mess around with. The result of this has since
                caused them to be dubbed by the staff as "the Mangle". In Five Nights at Freddy's VR: Help Wanted,
                Mangle's main head is shown to be capable of swivelling vertically at a 360-degree angle.
