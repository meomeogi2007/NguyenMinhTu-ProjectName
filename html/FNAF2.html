                            - Welcome back to the new and improved Freddy Fazbear's Pizza!
                            <br>
                            - In Five Nights at Freddy's 2, the old and aging animatronics are joined by a new cast of
                            characters. They are kid-friendly, updated with the latest in facial recognition technology,
                            tied into local criminal databases, and promise to put on a safe and entertaining show for
                            kids and grown-ups alike!
                            <br>
                            - What could go wrong?
                            <br>
                            - As the new security guard working nights, your job is to monitor cameras and make sure
                            nothing goes wrong after-hours. The previous guard has complained about "conditions";
                            namely, the characters trying to get into the office (he has since been moved to day-shift).
                            So to make your job easier, you've been provided with your very own empty Freddy Fazbear
                            head, which should fool the animatronic characters into leaving you alone if they should
                            accidentally enter your office.
                            <br>
                            - As always, Fazbear Entertainment is not responsible for death or dismemberment.

                                    - Like the first game, it is an indie point-and-click survival horror video game in
                                    which the player must again survive the night in the "new and improved" Freddy
                                    Fazbear's Pizza while avoiding the animatronics.
                                    <br>
                                    - There are six brand-new animatronics, as well as deteriorated versions of the
                                    original five from the first game, totaling the amount to eleven. There are several
                                    major differences to the game's mechanics compared to the first, most notably the
                                    removal of the Doors and the addition of the Freddy Fazbear Head.

                    - The promotional poster for the game was first uploaded on Scott's official website on September
                    12, 2014. Official pictures released by Scott Cawthon suggested that the original animatronics may
                    have gone into disrepair like Foxy and have been replaced by new ones.

                    - However, following the release of the first teaser image, two more images surfaced, depicting the
                    current Bonnie and Foxy alongside the newer models of the same characters. Further updates from
                    Scott's website show that a new animatronic would be joining the cast of already confirmed
                    characters - a clown-like puppet appearing in what is now known as the Prize Corner.

                    - A two-night demo was released. Three-night demos were released to certain YouTubers such as
                    Markiplier. Soon after the demo came out, the full game was released.

                        - Five Nights at Freddy's 2 received generally positive reviews from critics. Omri Petitte from
                        PC Gamer gave the game a score of 70 out of 100, commenting that what he wanted in the sequel
                        "was more mind games and more uncertainty. I wanted the plodding animatronic suits to find me
                        and rip my face off in new and interesting ways. I wanted working legs. What I got was a horror
                        game dipping heavily into deception and subtlety, a wonderfully cruel cocktail of supernatural
                        mystery and jolts of panicked adrenaline. Enjoying the good parts, though, comes with a cost of
                        the frustratingly steep difficulty."
