                        <br>
                        - Foxy is an animatronic pirate fox as well as a major antagonist in the Five Nights at Freddy's
                        franchise. He is a discontinued animatronic entertainer who resides at his own separated stage
                        from Freddy Fazbear's Pizza.
                        <br>
                        - Along with the other animatronics, Foxy will try to forcefully stuff any human she sees after
                        hours into a Freddy Fazbear suit, resulting in death. Chica like the other classic animatronics
                        was once a human child who was killed and now haunts the animatronic looking for revenge against
                        her murderer William Afton.
                        <div class="neat-header">Physical Appearance</div>
                        <div class="under-neat-header">Classic Foxy</div>
                        <br>
                        - Foxy is a large, animatronic fox with crimson tattered fur. He has yellow eyes, red eyebrows,
                        and three strings of hair from the top of his head. He has a hook for his right hand and his
                        left hand has been worn down to the endoskeleton. He also bears an eye patch that is folded over
                        his right eye, although he is usually seen with it above his eye rather than covering it. Unlike
                        the stereotypical fox, Foxy doesn't have a tail.
                        <br>
                        - Foxy wears brown linen pants that are especially shredded at the legs. He appears to be
                        damaged, as parts of his machinery are exposed. It can clearly be seen that both his legs, with
                        the exception of his upper thighs, and his left hand is completely bare, exposing the metal
                        endoskeleton underneath. His chest is ripped in various places, showing the endoskeleton
                        beneath, and his arms and stomach are torn apart as well, with tuffs of fur on the shoulders. He
                        also seems to have a slightly droopy left eyelid. Like all of the other Fazbear characters, Foxy
                        has a set of teeth. Foxy's teeth, however, appear to be the sharpest out of all the
                        animatronics, being similar to those of an actual canine, while the other animatronics' teeth
                        resemble human-like dentures or herbivorous teeth. It's also notable that, in keeping with the
                        pirate motif, he has several golden teeth and also appears to have some teeth missing, though
                        this may be due to him needing repairs. He also has a hanging jaw; this is also likely due to
                        him needing repairs. His ears are articulated, thus able to move back and forth and left to
                        right. His upper jaw muzzle is speckled on the sides with black dots, indicating beard stubble
                        or translucent whiskers. It is possible that these whiskers may have simply been removed due to
                        disrepair.
                        <div class="under-neat-header">Withered Foxy</div>
                        <br>
                        - Withered Foxy, Foxy's withered form, first appears in Five Nights at Freddy's 2 and makes a
                        cameo in Five Nights at Freddy's 3, and finally returns in Five Nights at Freddy's VR: Help
                        Wanted as an antagonist. He, along with the four other older animatronics have all fallen into
                        severe disrepair and he is replaced by his newer counterpart for the "improved" Freddy Fazbear's
                        Pizza due to an attempted retrofit of the older animatronics that took place before they got
                        scrapped for the newer models, such as Mangle.[2] Withered Foxy's suit has become even more
                        tattered and the fur on his left ear has come off completely. The teeth of his endoskeleton are
                        now clearly visible, this being true with every old animatronic. However, when comparing his
                        appearance and even his voice to Withered Bonnie, Withered Chica, or even his brand new
                        counterpart Mangle, Foxy actually seems to be in better shape, since, just like Withered Freddy,
                        the worst damage he has on him are just some huge rips. Unlike some of the aforementioned
                        animatronics, Foxy is not entirely stripped off his costume, nor is he missing his face or any
                        limbs.

                <div class="neat-header">Personality</div>
                - As Foxy's attraction title would imply, Foxy's personality is that of a stereotypical pirate, often
                using pirate slang, all with a pirate accent. One of his lines also suggests claustrophobia. According
                to a game over screen in Five Nights at Freddy's VR: Help Wanted, Foxy is perceptive, and not easily
                deceived. Based on Freddy Fazbear's description of Foxy in the Freddy Fazbear's Pizza Theme Song, he is
                implied to be reclusive, based on the fact that Freddy Fazbear sings about Foxy, rather than Foxy
                singing himself only helps prove this.
                <br>
                - Chica also seems to be very pushy and determined, as when she gets to the night guard's door, she will
                stay there for long periods of time far longer than Bonnie would.
                <br>
                - As shown in Curse of Dreadbear, Foxy seems to be aware of his dilapidated look when he warns the
                player to stay inside the ride. He also threatens the player saying he will send them to "Davy Jones'
                locker" if they do poorly. His lines also sound as if they were being played over loudspeakers, as
                opposed to emanating from Foxy himself.
                <br>
                - In Special Delivery, Foxy acts and speaks in a more aggressive, mocking, and belittling matter,
                seemingly taking delight in tormenting the player.
                <br>
                - As Withered Foxy, nothing much is known about his personality, however due to his behavior in Five
                Nights at Freddy's 2 and the rest of the games he's in, it shows that he is aggressive and hostile
                towards his victims. Like the other withered animatronics, he seems to be quite intimidating. Withered
                Foxy seems to act pretty violent as well, this is evidenced by his pose in the hallway where he is
                holding his hook up ready to dismember the guard's head off.

                <div class="neat-header">Functionality</div>
                - He is revealed in Help Wanted to have control fuses in certain parts of his body, which allow his
                servos to properly function. Without said fuses or if there's a fuse in the wrong receptacle, he
                malfunctions.
                <div class="neat-header">References</div>
                1. "Uh, now concerning your safety, the only real risk to you as a night watchman here, if any, is the
                fact that these characters, uh, if they happen to see you after hours probably won't recognize you as a
                person. They'll p-most likely see you as a metal endoskeleton without its costume on. Now since that's
                against the rules here at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, they'll probably try to...forcefully stuff you inside
                a Freddy Fazbear suit. Um, now, that wouldn't be so bad if the suits themselves weren't filled with
                crossbeams, wires, and animatronic devices, especially around the facial area. So, you could imagine how
                having your head forcefully pressed inside one of those could cause a bit of discomfort...and death. Uh,
                the only parts of you that would likely see the light of day again would be your eyeballs and teeth when
                they pop out the front of the mask, heh." - Phone Guy, Night 1

                2. "Uh, by now I'm sure you've noticed the older models sitting in the back room. Uh, those are from the
                previous location. We just use them for parts now. The idea at first was to repair them...uh, they even
                started retrofitting them with some of the newer technology, but they were just so ugly, you know? The
                smell...uh, so the company decided to go in a whole new direction and make them super kid-friendly. Uh,
                those older ones shouldn't be able to walk around, but if they do, the whole Freddy head trick should
                work on them too, so, whatever." - Phone Guy, Night 2
