                        <br>
                        - The Puppet (also known as the Marionette) is an animatronic puppet from the 1987 Freddy
                        Fazbear's Pizza location, although it's implied that it was originally from Fredbear's Family
                        Diner. It first debuts in Five Nights at Freddy's 2 as the overarching antagonist, but later
                        games show its heroic side. The identity of the soul possessing this animatronic is Charlotte
                        Emily.
                        <div class="neat-header">Physical Appearance</div>
                        <br>
                        - The Puppet has a white face (which looks like a mask) with black, hollow eyes that sometimes
                        gain small, white pupils. Its face is similar to that of a Pierrot, with rosy red cheeks, purple
                        stripes that stretch from the bottom of its eyes to the top of its mouth, and red lipstick
                        painted on in an exaggerated pucker.
                        <br>
                        - Its body is somewhat reminiscent of a sock monkey's, with its round, oblong shape, thin waist,
                        three white buttons, rounded hands that feature three spindly fingers each, and white stripes on
                        the wrists and ankles, along with a thin, long neck. It has no feet, but its legs are tapered to
                        a point. It has neither hair nor head accessories. It's quite lanky, and according to one of the
                        hallucinations in which it appears, it stretches from the floor to the ceiling of the pizzeria.
                        <br>
                        - In Five Nights at Freddy's VR: Help Wanted, the Puppet's body has a rusty looking brown color
                        covering its entire body, head downwards. Its mask is also scratched, especially on the cheeks
                        and lips. It is depicted in both animations and the gallery as moving its arms in a wavy
                        fashion.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <div class="neat-header">Personality</div>
                        <br>
                         - The Puppet was originally an inanimate object, and therefore had no personality of its own, until it
                        was seemingly possessed by the spirit of Charlotte Emily who was the daughter of Henry Emily the
                        company's founder. As seen in the Completion ending of Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria Simulator as well as
                        the Security Puppet minigame, the Puppet short-circuited in the rain, while holding Charlie, allowing
                        her spirit to enter the Puppet and take over. As it is confirmed to speak in Ultimate Custom Night. The
                        Puppet is seemingly vengeful and sadistic, claiming to be very aware; even Phone Guy states that it is
                        "always thinking".
                        <br>
                        - Despite this, the Puppet seemingly harbors no resentment against anyone it deems a threat (claiming
                        they need to stay out of the way), though it does display sadistic tendencies, especially towards the
                        player character in Ultimate Custom Night, such as musing at the fact they're powerless. It is also
                        protective of the "Others", possibly referring to the other children murdered by William Afton, who now
                        possess the animatronics Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, Foxy, and Golden Freddy, although it also claims they
                        are "like animals" (incapable of thinking for themselves) showing that the spirit that possess the
                        Puppet retains it's intellect. This is further shown as it is one of the only animatronics not fooled by
                        the Freddy Fazbear Head. It talks to the player with familiarity, mentioning that it is no longer afraid
                        of them, suggesting that the player is someone who used to be feared by the Puppet.
