                        <br>
                        - Toy Freddy is one of the toy animatronics of the Five Nights at Freddy's series, first
                        appearing in Five Nights at Freddy's 2. He is Freddy Fazbear's "redesigned" counterpart from the
                        past and an improved replacement of Freddy's pre-rebuilt incarnation Withered Freddy, serving as
                        the mascot of the newly refurbished Freddy Fazbear's Pizza of 1987.
                        <div class="neat-header">Physical Appearance</div>
                        <br>
                        - Toy Freddy has a similar appearance to his original counterpart. He is a brown animatronic
                        bear with light brown coloring on his stomach, snout, and inner ears. He has black whisker
                        spots, black eyebrows, brown eyelids, short eyelashes, blue eyes, and a black nose. As with the
                        other toy animatronics, Toy Freddy has rosy red, blushed cheeks. However, unlike the other toy
                        animatronics, he appears to have a matte coating rather than a glossy finish. His arms and legs
                        are multi-jointed, like the other toy animatronics, but most appear darker.
                        <br>
                        - Toy Freddy's face is much flatter, wider, and significantly more round than the original
                        Freddy Fazbear's, with noticeably more buck teeth. He also seems to be the widest of the toy
                        animatronics, as his body is much bigger compared to that of the original Freddy's. His ears are
                        also much smaller and more oval in shape. He wears a black bow tie with two black buttons
                        beneath it. He also wears a small black top hat with a red stripe. In his right hand, he holds a
                        silver and black microphone.
                        <br>
                        - Toy Freddy's eyes normally appear to be similar to those of the other animatronics, but upon
                        entering the Office, his eyes turn to a glossy-black that cause his eyes to look empty.
                        <br>
                        - In Five Nights at Freddy's VR: Help Wanted, he seems to be a darker brown. Plus, he has no
                        teeth on his upper jaw, similar to his original counterpart from Five Nights at Freddy's.
                        <br>
                        <div class="neat-header">Personality</div>
                        <br>
                        - Scott Cawthon describes him as "private and reclusive". Toy Freddy's personality, as suggested
                        in his quotes from Ultimate Custom Night, he appears pouty, wisecracking, and childish as he
                        will get upset by his own failure to beat video games, especially the "Five Nights with Mr.
                        Hugs" game.
                        <br>
                        - In Five Nights at Freddy's AR: Special Delivery, Toy Freddy speaks in a more affable manner,
                        seemingly treating the player as a friend.
